									<h2>The City of the Spectacle: A Media-Spatial Analysis of the Jamsil Lotte Complex</h2>
									<p>Drawing from media-spatial analysis methods, this paper focused on the interactions between media and space, to identify the functions of the spectacle and its impact on the construction of the cultural identities of the Jamsil Lotte complex. Jamsil Lotte complex is a commercial and cultural complex located in the center of Seoul, South Korea. In this paper, Jamsil Lotte complex is examined as a city of media spectacle within the context of urban development. Approaching with a media-spatial perspective, I employed Walter Benjamin's theoretical notions such as ‘phantasmagoria’ to explore urban modernity by reconstructing the complex into multiple analytical places.</p>

									<h2><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/3/1062">The Relationship between Future Anxiety Due to COVID-19 and Vigilance: The Role of Message Fatigue and Autonomy Satisfaction</a></h2>
									<p>PI: Prof. Roselyn J. Lee-Won (OSU), Prof. Hyun-Suk Kim (SNU), Prof. Sung-Gwan Park (SNU)<br>
									Supported by: Seoul National University (SNU), BK21 Four program of the Ministry of Education of the Repulic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea</p>

									<p>How does future anxiety caused by the COVID-19 pandemic relate to people’s willingness to remain vigilant and adhere to preventive measures? We examined the mediating role of message fatigue and the moderating role of autonomy satisfaction in the relationship between future anxiety due to COVID-19 and willingness to remain vigilant. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted with adults residing in the United States in June 2021 when numerous U.S. states re-opened following the CDC’s relaxed guidelines for fully vaccinated individuals. Our data showed that message fatigue mediated the relationship between future anxiety due to the pandemic and willingness to remain vigilant. The data further revealed that autonomy satisfaction significantly moderated the mediation. </p>

									<h2>A Multimodal Analysis on the Composition of Meaning and Experience in the Mediated Exhibition Space of Poetic AI</h2>
									<p><i>Poetic AI </i> is an exhibition that has been reinterpreted as digital art by machine learning and AI algorithms from New Media Creative Studio OUCHH, which started in Turkey, collecting and analyzing data written by about 20 million scientists. <i>The Poetic AI </i> exhibition space has been screened by mapping more than 136 projectors on a screen surrounding the slope and floor. In a modern society where media art gradually expands to various sizes and AI experiences penetrate daily life, Ground Seesaw Myeong-dong, Seoul, South Korea, where AI media art <i> Poetic AI </i> is displayed, becomes a cultural space for a new art form emerging in the present era. To combine existing media art and AI art research and to understand the meaning and experience of exhibition space as a cultural place, this study approached <i>poetic AI</i> exhibition space through multimodal analysis. In addition, to understand the visitors' experiences, field research and interview have been conducted and the media representation has been analyzed on the Instagram posts derived by searching the hashtag <i>#Poetic AI</i>.</p>

									<h2>"What does your day taste like?" Non-symbolic communication through the taste of tea capsules</h2>
									<p>Looking back and communicating with the other person's condition and emotions in a complicated and busy daily life becomes a labor with very high intensity and complexity. The word 'Sik-gu 식구' refers to family members who live in one space and share meals. Currently, various types of alternative families and solidarity emerge, and the concept of the family becomes the point where a sense of belonging to alternative communities and solidarity arises. Like families sharing the same food, sharing emotions, and solidarity, this study attempts to experiment with a new type of communication that converts individual schedules and stress indices into ‘taste’ and shares them together. To this end, a taste scale according to emotions and stress conditions was devised, and an app called <i>BesTEA</i> was designed to measure schedule and stress and extract it as a taste of tea.</p>
